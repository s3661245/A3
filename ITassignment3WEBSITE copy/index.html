							<h2>Industry Data</h2>
							<class="actions uniform">
							<p> 
								In Canvas, you will find a link to some industry data supplied by Burning Glass. 
								You should use this (as well as any other data you may be able to find) to answer the following questions.<br />
								<br /> 1. What are the Job Titles for your group’s ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? 
								<br />Angela: An Interactive Programmer
								<br />Joseph: IT Support Officer/Specialist/Technician
								<br />Lewis: Backend Software Developer
								<br />James: VR rendering developer
								<br />Shams: UX designer
								<br />Harman: Team Leader of Biomedical Engineers Team
								<br />From the industry data supplied by Burning Glass, ‘Software Developers/Engineers’ is the occupation that has the 
								highest selection within the field of Information Technology, as a total of 29,456 Software Developers have been selected 
								within the company Burning Glass. The ideal job of a ‘Backend Software Developer’ from Lewis may be categorised into this occupation. 
								A ‘Help Desk Officer’ from Joseph’s ideal job description is ranked fifth in terms of the demand from employers who has hired 9,416 in 
								the last two months in Burning Glass. In eighth place, the occupation ‘Computer Programmer’ has a large amount of hired 
								employees as 4,436 has been recruited for Burning Glass. In terms of the group’s ideal jobs, an ‘Interactive Programmer’ from Angela’s 
								ideal job may relatively fit within this category of occupations. Within the data of the Top Burning Glass Occupations, 
								the ‘UI/UX Designer’ is placed fourteenth, with a number of 2,848 employees. For James’ ideal job as a ‘VR Rendering Developer’, 
								this occupation may fit within the occupation as the ‘Multimedia Designer/Animator’, as this places 19th place out of 25 occupations 
								from Burning Glass’ Top Occupations data list. As for Harman’s ideal job as a Team Leader for a Biomedical Team, Burning Glass 
								does not have the appropriate data as it is an IT based company, however according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the employment 
								of Biomedical Engineers is estimated up to 20,100 employees in 2017. <br />

								<br /> 2. From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group’s  required skill set ). These can be divided into general skills  (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and  IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).
								<br />	a. How do the  IT-specific skills  in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
								<br /> From the industry data supplied by Burning Glass, Java and Javascript are the highest ranking specific skill that would be 
								required by most of the group members with over 5,000 active selections collectively. Following this would be graphics design 
								in second place with 2000 selections, a skill needed by members such as Angela.
								The third ranked skill would be technical support with 1800 selection, a skill required by those such as Joseph.
								The fourth ranked skill is C# according to Burning glass with 1643 selections, this is skill is required or several of our group 
								members such as Angela, Lewis, James, Shams and Harman. <br />

								<br />	b. How do the  general skills  in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
								<br /> From the industry data supplied by Burning Glass, the number one general skill required was communication skills with 44,367 
								selections. This is a skill required for all group members, but primarily those such as Joseph and Harman in their chosen 
								professions. Second ranking would be problem solving with 16,445 active selections, another skill needed from all group members 
								but primarily those such as Lewis, Joseph and Harman. Team work/Collaboration ranks third amongst the group with 14,364 active 
								selections and is required by all of the group members. <br />

								<br />	c. What are the three highest ranked  IT-specific skills  which are not in your required skill set?
								<br /> Firstly the highest ranked IT specific skill that is not in the required skill set would be SQL, with 3570, 
								active selections, followed by SAP, with 2189 active selections. Then finally Business management would rank third with 2141 
								active selections as a skill not required by any of the group members.. <br />
								<br />	d. What are the three highest ranked  general skills  which are not in your required skill set?
								<br /> Firstly the highest ranked general skill not required in the skill set according to Burning glass would be, research 
								with 7227 active selections, followed by mentoring, with 4538 active selections. Then finally “Self-Starter” would rank third 
								with 1984 active selections as a skill not required by any of the group members. 
								General skills that many companies have high in demand are communication skills, team building, as well as researching. 
								These skills may not be up to standards, however through experience and self motivation to take action, these skills can 
								strengthen in each members of the Wallflower Inc. <br />
								
								<br />	3. Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
								<br /> After viewing the statistics from the Burning Glass data, a majority of the group members are still passionate about 
								their ideal jobs, hence, all members of Wallflower Inc has not changed their ideal job changed even after seeing the data. 
								Most group members have analysed what type of professional interpersonal skills they need to strengthen, generally such as 
								problem solving and organisational skills, as well as IT skills such as developing and strengthening in programming languages 
								in Python or C#. <br />

						<ul class="alt">
							<li><h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3></li>
							<p>		<span class="image right"><img src="images/autonomousv.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									An autonomous vehicle is any vehicle (most commonly cars) that has the ability to complete certain tasks and actions 
									without the input from a human. Currently autonomous vehicles have a special classification to describe the height of 
									its self-driving abilities, ranging from level 0 to level 5. Starting from level 0 (No Automation), this involves no autonomy, 
									where the driver has full control of the car. The car does not have any ability to maneuver itself or assist the driver in any 
									situation. Level 1(Driver Assistance) is where the car can now control certain functions the car such as either steering, 
									acceleration or braking. Level 2 (Partial Automation) allows the car to be able to steer, accelerate, decelerate and brake, 
									all while the driver does not have his hands on the wheel. Level 3 (Conditional Automation) now allows the car to completely 
									drive in the correct conditions, where driver input is only needed in conditions where the car cannot navigate. 
									Currently, most if not all car manufacturers are at level 3 of automation. Level 4 (High automation) These vehicles have the 
									ability to perform close to all road driving tasks without user input, but do not cover every driving situation. 
									Level 5 (Full automation), at this level the car will be no different to that of a human driver, and will require no human 
									input whatsoever.<br />
									Autonomous car are equipped with a multitude of sensors and radars called “LIDAR”. This allows for the vehicle to have a 
									complete perspective of its surroundings, as well as have the ability to be able to perceive aspects of the road such as lane 
									markings, street lights and road signs and evidently other cars. Ultimately this allows for car to be able to safely drive 
									itself on the road, with little to no input from the actual driver. Currently the most common autonomous vehicle technology 
									available for consumer purchase is being developed by car manufacturers such as Tesla, Mercedes and Audi. 
									Currently these cars have the ability to detect up to 5 metres around the car in any direction while traveling at any speed, 
									this allows the car to be able to make safe and cautious decisions when deciding if it is appropriate to complete actions such 
									as changing lanes. Some cars can see up to hundreds of metres ahead, but they still depend on human input in many road conditions.. 
									The technology lets the car control the breaks and speed of the car while traveling in a lane, steer the car, change lanes and 
									self-park, both in perpendicular and parallel. In addition, the driver is not required to even be in the car to be begin 
									operating it, as manufactures such as both Tesla and Audi  have developed technology that allows these cars to automatically 
									start and drive towards the users, as well as park themselves again. In the next 3 years vehicles are expected to be able to reach 
									level 4 automation. Currently the only vehicle close to this is the Google “FireFly” pod car, which can operate without a steering 
									wheel or pedal, but can only travel at a top speed of 25 mph, enabling performance in real world scenarios.
									Development of these level 4 vehicles is being made possible through the advancements of LIDAR sensors which are not only close to 
									50% cheaper in comparison to previous years, but also have been improved in their operation, allowing for increased research and 
									development into autonomous vehicle technology. Level 5 autonomous vehicles are still not available for consumers, and some 
									concept level 5 vehicles show up in auto shows. We are have a long way to go before level 5 vehicles are available to consumers.
									<br /> <br />
									Overall, autonomous vehicles will have a positive impact in the world. Primarily, the development of these vehicles would result in a substantial drop in the amount of car accidents that occur across the world due to the partial elimination of human error in these incidents.  Furthermore these vehicles would have the ability to autonomously do things such as collect data for mobile service and technology supplier’s which would overall result in an increase in both research and development in technology and the global economy. Additionally, development of these autonomous vehicles would also soon result in the development of electric vehicles which are superior to petrol vehicles in terms of protecting the environment resulting in overall lower global energy consumption.
									Conversely, autonomous vehicles could have a negative impact because of the amount of jobs that could be made redundant due to their use. This would primarily include jobs such as truck and taxi driving, the most common jobs in countries such as the USA. This would also affect people such as mechanics and auto body repair shops due to the significant decrease in car problems and accidents that will occur. Even government jobs such as public transport positions train, bus, V-line and tram drivers will be effects as a driver is no longer needed for their operation.
									In our daily lives, autonomous vehicles will affect in us in various ways. Personally, autonomous vehicles would overall improve public transport, a major aspect of daily life, as autonomous vehicles would improve transport planning as data could be collected on road and traffic matters. Additionally, costs of transport would overall decrease due to less money being spent of paying employees who would usually drive public transport services. Furthermore, this could affect certain family member and friends, most notably those who are elder or disabled. Allowing them to be more mobile than they otherwise could have been.

							<li><h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3></li>
							<p>    <span class="image left"><img src="images/shutterstock_642290062.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
									Cryptocurrency is a cashless anonymous payment system that can be modified to accommodate internet of things (IOT) applications. 
									For example, Expedia now recognises bitcoin as a new payment option for hotel bookings, but it has the potential to include payment 
									for flights and activities among various other services. 
									Blockchain, on the other hand, is the actual system cryptocurrency runs on. It is a ledger which is distributed to everyone, everywhere 
									and to all cryptocurrency users. Every time a transaction goes through it goes on a ledger. 
									A ledger can only hold so much memory before a new “block” must be created hence the term “blockchain”. 
									To verify if the transaction has occurred mathematical signatures that need to be mined by “miners” are required. 
									Any user on the blockchain can mine and verify the transaction which is what makes it safe. 
									Blockchain offers an open decentralised database for any transaction that holds value where any member of the community has the 
									ability to verify the transaction hence making it safe. Those that do verify the transaction by mining do get rewarded for doing so.<br /> <br />
									
									Verge is an entirely private network based globally (supports widespread mass adoption) and is a flexible and fast way to exchange currencies. 
									Verge encourages low cost transactions to be private, fast and efficient so individuals can send and receive payments however they want and for whatever 
									they choose to buy. This is done through the use of multiple anonymity-based networks such at TOR and I2P which allows the IP addresses of the users to be obfuscated.
									Cryptocurrency has a secure method of fraud prevention through use of cryptography. Crypto-coins stay safe because of “keys” which are blocks of information that can be used to 
									make mathematical guarantees about messages in order to confirm that whoever is sending the coins is the actual owner of the coins. Keys are given to an individual once they have 
									created an account for cryptocurrencies. This account is called a “wallet” in which two unique keys are given, private and public. 
									The private key is given the ability to take some data and be able to “sign” it so other users on the blockchain have the ability to verify the signature if they choose to.
									Private keys cannot be replicated by another user. To be able to see and verify the transaction, the public key is used to see if the signature is valid. 
									Hence, if the public key works that is clear evidence that the coins sent was signed by the private key and was something that was meant to be sent.
									<br /> <br />
									In the next three years, it is expected that peer to peer trading will become more common for more uncommon things such as paying off energy trading. 
									Power ledger have collaborated with KEPCO in Japan to establish a direct link between the power ledger and the meter in which the Power ledger platform can access the meters 
									data hence the appropriate billing and trading of coins to pay off that debt will occur accordingly. 
									Power ledger will provide KEPCO access to their platform, so they can be able to monitor electricity transactions between users which enables and incorporates 
									peer to peer trading methods hence giving an opportunity to also generate invoicing, evaluating the trading position of each individual participant and validating the 
									security and accuracy of the platform.
									The major technological companies will become more decentralised. Facebook released a statement saying that technology was meant to be a decentralizing force that was for the people 
									and now because of the rise of a small amount of major tech companies and governments using technology to watch their citizens, technology has become a way that centralises power instead of decentralising it. 
									Mike Zuckerberg state that he would look at cryptocurrency and blockchain that take power from centralised systems available and place it back into the people’s hands.
									Technology experts also believe that cryptocurrency has the potential to store various kinds of confidential information in different ways such as in a way that another company or even the government 
									would not have any control or access on that information hence be free from its influence and the bias it may bring.
									This development will allow anyone around the world that has a mobile phone device and the internet to be able to set up their own wealth or “wallet”. 
									With cryptocurrency all that is needed is a mobile 
									device and an internet connection to be able to create a wallet and it’s completely free. People living in poverty or in low conditions don’t 
									have access to a bank account at all but some of them do have a mobile device and a connection to the internet. 
									Through this, the individual will be able to set up their own “wallet” and be able to trade and use their coins so they can either invest and 
									grow more or to trade for goods and services.
									When cryptocurrency got released banks finally had a competitor that they haven’t had for centuries. An opponent that will be able to challenge 
									their ways and regulations placing a centralised form of government to something that is decentralised and placed in the people’s hands. 
									Both of which can do the same thing, build wealth. When crypto became more popular the banks were forced to upgrade their systems and protocols, 
									so they can keep their customers hence Pay ID was introduced.
									<br /> <br />
									As an investor for bitcoin amongst various other cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is an opportunity for me to gain some financial gain. 
									Cryptocurrency allows me a way to increase my current wealth as the prices for each individual coin regularly fluctuate which allows me to keep 
									trading and build my wealth. The crypto coins that I would have allows me to potentially trade them for assorted items in the securely and in some 
									cases anonymously. This is different to me as monetary prices don’t fluctuate as much as cryptocurrency does hence allowing me to make a greater profit. 
									With cryptocurrency I would be able to directly transfer money almost instantaneously between people hence making it extremely efficient. 
									International money transfer takes approximately 5 business days to be able to transfer money in banks as it has multiple steps that need to be gone 
									through before the money reaches the recipient. However, the bitcoin protocol runs over the internet hence the recipient will receive your money 
									almost instantly.

							<li><h3>Cybersecurity</h3></li>
							<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/cyber-security-attack-safeguards-2017.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								Cyber crime is any crime that is directed at a computer, and one where a computer or device is integral to the offence. 
								It may be said that crime is a symptom of human culture. Since the first case of a human possessing what we now understand as a 'code of 
								ethics', law has generally existed within human cultures containing groups that collectively form positions of authoritative power. 
								The law exists to enforce abidance of its people to a set of rules considered representative of the group's collective definition of 
								morality. As human culture evolved and morphed over time, the acts considered worthy of punishment grew, and so too were news laws written.
								With the creation of the internet, humans entered an era filled with situations requiring a vast array of questions unanswered 
								by previous ways of thinking.
								The generality of the term Cybercrime feels representative in itself of answering difficult questions that must be answered 
								when deciding upon ideas of justice in the context of the internet – especially when the one deciding upon the answer is often 
								completely ill-equipped to make a sufficiently educated answer. An observation of recent events surrounding Facebook and their use 
								user metadata provides an example of this. <br /> <br />
								Common forms of cybercrime include:
								<li>phishing: using fake email messages to get personal information from internet users;</li> 
								<li>misusing personal information (identity theft); 	</li>
								<li>hacking: shutting down or misusing websites or computer networks;</li> 
								<li>spreading hate and inciting terrorism;</li> 	
								<li>distributing child pornography; </li>
								<li>grooming: making sexual advances to minors. </li>	
								<br />(Netherlands Government Website, https://www.government.nl/topics/cybercrime/forms-of-cybercrime)<br/> <br />

								The varied nature of this list shows the use of the term Cybercrime as an umbrella, used to identify not the crime committed, 
								but the location of the crime. Should we also call grass-root propaganda spreading a Cybercrime?
								The 'hacker' can be better understood with three different labels:
								the White hat works with businesses to locate any possible flaws in their system. 
								Permission has been granted before hand, often allowing for the hacker to test the 'social hacking' vulnerabilities within the 
								business. 
								The grey hat is similar to the white hat in that their work provides businesses with knowledge of potential threats in their 
								security. A grey hat hacker does not do it for money, and can often break the law when gaining access to confidential systems 
								without permission. Because of this, the morality behind the acts remain as a somewhat controversial topic. 
								For the hacker, exploring vulnerabilities often comes from a position of curiosity, and a chance to challenge their knowledge. 
								The black hat hacker is the term that identifies all hackers using their knowledge of hacking to commit crimes through the internet. 
								Finding people that commit these crimes is extremely difficult as Cyber crime is usually international in scope. 
								For black hat hackers, committing crime online can be extremely profitable. A large portion of users will not think to backup their files, 
								and when faced with the loss of irreplaceable items, they will simply just pay the money. Because of this, widespread attacks, 
								such as the recent Encryption virus that took the user's files hostage to get money through bitcoin, are extremely profitable when 
								exposed to enough victims.
								<br /> <br />
								With new technological change controversies, the general knowledge on the subject of Cybersecurity is growing. 
								Being “secure” is becoming less ambiguous, and business owners have had the chance to witness many examples of failure to 
								change with the times. Because of this, many services exist to provide a legal and rewarding incentive for grey hat hackers to 
								do the right thing with the information they find.
								<br /> <br />What is the likely impact? <br />
								The current shift in understanding and curiosity towards Cybersecurity has allowed for increased discussions surrounding the 
								mainly ignored vulnerabilities within technology used extensively in both private homes and the in the public. 
								Logically, this should eventually result in Governments reevaluating their country's rules and legislation in order to answer 
								the privacy concerns of the population, as well as the security falls capable through business and government. 
								In 2017, the cost of Cybercrime attacks came to $11.7 million USD; a 23% increase from the previous year. 
								With international access to the internet constantly increasing, the portion of each country's population harnessing ill intent 
								will gain also gain access to this new and highly profitable form of crime.
								National infrastructures that require the internet to function are at big risk from capable attackers. 
								Alongside this, many large scale companies that have already incorporated internet connected devices into their functioning, 
								must be sure that their product was built with strong security implemented in its design. 
								The hype that the web of things has caused may see many unaware business owners being sold products that do not meet sufficient 
								security standards, endangering their users and business. The result of an attack on services and products used by society 
								could potentially cause a serious and damaging disruption on functioning society.
								The internet of things is predicted to explode in the very near future, as the technology gets better companies begin to 
								understand the capabilities of the technology, as well as the level of cost and labour to do it successfully. 
								In a world with 50 billion connected devices, the plethora of technologies being used would be vast. 
								It is not possible to design a single network that meets the requirements of all devices as all devices differ.
								<br /> <br />How will this affect you? <br />
								There are many things that a person concerned with the issue of Cybercrime can do in order to be better capable of avoiding 
								become the victim of an online criminal. When browsing the internet, one may think to explore the large number of browser 
								Add-Ons available to them, and choose one that is respected and fits their needs. Ad-Blocker removes ads on webpages – 
								most of the time. Such a service is obviously heavily disliked by companies providing adSpace services, however it also does 
								away with a lot of the online content that can potentially give your computer a virus without proper handling. 
								Any device or electrical purchases made may be checked before buying to see their security capabilities. 
								If in the future I decide to start a business, it would be silly to not consider security aspects at every level of my 
								implementation.
								Having the chance to consider the potential disaster that being the victim of Cybercrime, people can begin to realise 
								the severity that being careless online can cause to ones life. I, alongside many others, now take seriously the attempt at 
								maintaining a somewhat secure online presence.</p>
							
							<li><h3>Robots</h3></li>
							<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/asimo.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								A robot is a automated mechanical machine that has a program within its hardware system, which can enhance or assist with 
								activities in the everyday life of the human race. The state of the art of robots is greatly advanced compared to historical periods, 
								since the continuous growth of artificial intelligence has improved well as a result from developing science and technology milestones step 
								by step. The main characteristics that determine what a robot is, are distinguishing components like whether the machine can detect its 
								surrounding environment, can execute tasks autonomously without any human control, intelligently respond to complex problems such as ‘sensing’ and ‘actuation’. 
								There are many different types of state of the art robotics and they all enhance and excel at a task greater than what a human can. 
								For example, a state of the art robot can perform an extremely precise medical procedure better than any human doctor as human error may occur. 
								However, there are other State of the art robotics that affect completely different areas and fields. Such as a robot intelligently recording and 
								sending data from different planets back to earth. What may be implemented in the not so distant future is a full robotic AI which can use enhanced 
								learning to enhance different capabilities. Artificial Intelligence robots can be used for close to anything and can help complete complex and simple tasks 
								without having to be programmed exactly what to do, it will be able to learn what to do and how to do it. <br />
								However, it will not be able to be creative or come up with ideas. A advanced AI robot like might be available in 3 year however it is doubtful that it would 
								have a consumer friendly price and can be priced in the million’s, but nonetheless is can still be developed and made.
								There a lot of developments that could make advancement in AI possible, improved programming and new programming languages, as well as better batteries and 
								performance functions, increased processing power will allow the AI to understand and think more intelligently faster.
								There are many potential impact of this development as this can change the way people live and use technology as it could become a part of everyone lives all the time. 
								Depending on how the AI robot is used for this could dramatically speed up research in multiple different areas of study, fix a dangerous or potentially 
								dangerous situation in, increase the general standard of living that a person has. As the AI robotics has huge potential there are some general good and bad 
								examples of what potential could happen sometime in the future. A positive difference that Ai robots could have to people is to perform tasks that other 
								people might not want to do or wish to do such as mundane house work like clean the dishes, go to buy groceries dropping off or pick children up from school, 
								lifting heavy objects. This could affect all types of people equally as it could change the way everyone lives such as helping a child do their homework for 
								however long they are need, to helping an adult with complex problems or doing simple house chores, to looking after the elderly assisting them with any of 
								their need and making sure medication is taking on time and that they always have medication to take.<br /> <br />
								However, AI robotics could have a very negative side such as creating robots to fight in wars and to kill other people. 
								Such an advancement would make the robot capable of wiping out people that do not have this technology and may encourage nations to go to war with each other as it 
								has a technology advantage and can easily defeat other countries that don’t have this technology. Even if robot fought for a against another country 
								with robots then it would be commercialising war which made lead to encouraging war. Even if no human lives are taken in that sort of war, lot of resources 
								could be wasted on a war for commercial proposed rather than on other useful things that advanced AI robotics could offer. As the price of AI would be way 
								too high for the general population AI robotics would be mostly used with research that has a significantly high budget such as NASA. 
								High tech business may also use AI robotics in and around its business to increase work productivity and performance. 
								This would not change much for many people until it becomes integrated in today current world. This technology has the potential to make a lot of current 
								jobs redundant such as from almost every sector such as taxi driver, checkout people at stores, infantry soldiers, babysitting, surgical doctors, assistant 
								jobs, etc. it has the potential to make most jobs from basic tasks and complex task redundant but cannot make research jobs or jobs implementing ideas jobs. 
								Although it would make many jobs related to how the robots are used and how the feature of the robot can be improved. In my daily life if AI robots are 
								affordable this would improve my transport use and could be used to helping me get from place to place, do general job around the house like cleaning, cooking, 
								laundry, taking out the bins etc. It can also help me with studies by repeating information that it has currently available to it. 
								What would be different for me is that I would not use it in a business environment where other people may be using AI in their daily jobs and around their 
								house. This will affect my family and friends by giving them more time to do whatever they wanted and would make them happier to not do mundane house work.</p>

									<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
								</header>
								<class="actions uniform">
										<h3>Description</h3>
										Similar to apps like Messenger and Tinder, GigAtlas will require the user to give access to their Facebook page 
										by logging in. In doing so, the user gives GigAtlas access all metadata for events attending and/or invited to for the 
										user and their Facebook friends. 
										The home screen of the application will not be dissimilar to the application Uber, in that the user will be immediately 
										greeted by a map of their current location showing their location at the centre. The screen will initially show the map 
										with a 5km radius around the user. On the bottom-right corner of the map side is a function allowing the user to zoom in 
										and out, thus revealing apps that fall inside or outside of the range shown (when closed, the chosen level of zoom will 
										be saved and used again when the app is reopened). 
										<br /> <br />
										Within a drop down menu, a calendar function will allow the user to choose which dates they wish to view events for. 
										The user will be able to create a list of 'tags' that they can attach to an event. This will be useful for users interested 
										in a variety of musical genres, as they will be given the option to view a list of events sharing the same tag. 
										When the user clicks on an event, they will be shown the event information such as the time, promoter and description. 
										This will not open the Facebook app, but be shown within the original app. Added to the event information will be a section 
										that provides links to external sites, such as an artist's website or any locations in which the user may stream their music. 
										Each event will have a share option, allowing to user to send information of the event through a range of other services 
										(such as text message, Messenger, Email etc.).
										<br /> <br />
										The user can filter which events they're shown based on 'Attending', 'Interested in' and invitations they have not yet 
										responded to. Similar to the feature available in Facebook, the user will be able to view a refined selection of events 
										popular within their social circle. However, unlike Facebook, GigAtlas will display this as a map.
										<br /><br />
										<p> <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
												<li>Privacy </li>
												With the current climate surrounding the privacy of individuals on the internet, it should be 
												acknowledged that a service of this nature may face questioning over its use of user’s personal data. 
												On May 25th the European Union will launch the General Data Protection Regulation. 
												This will see many companies not willing to change to meet new regulation standards faced with large fines. 
												Such rules apply to all companies within the EU, and all companies outside of the EU that have EU users/customers 
												or use network infrastructure within the EU. It would therefore be logical to adhere to said standards in order to 
												maximize the quantity of potential users.
												<br /> <br />
												<li>Location detection</li>
												With location detection you want to make sure that the user is in the right place, and that events 
												around fall within the correct kilometre distance selected by the user. 
												<br/> <br />
												<li>Storage space</li>
												The amount of metadata used required for the functioning of this application could potentially be large, 
												in which case storage space would end up being a bottleneck. With increased storage requirements comes 
												increased cost. Funding would therefore also need to be found. 
												<br /> <br />
												<li>Cluttered functionality</li>
												Many features within the project include calendar functions, ‘tags’ features, using a map-oriented format 
												for events, sharing social events to users’ social circle, viewing the events filters based on ‘Attending’ and 
												‘Interested In’. With the great number of features within the project, the functionality of the application may 
												clutter within the user interface of the app, and hence, is another challenge encountered.
												<br /> <br />
												<li>Compatibility with mobile devices</li>
												There may be issues with the compatibility with users who use older models of mobile devices, as the mobile software may not allow the data space to run within the mobile device.
												</p>

							<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
							<class="actions uniform">
							<p> Overall, the group agrees that completion of the assignment went particularly smoothly throughout the preceding weeks. 
								Unanimously, the group agreed that a primary thing that went well with the assignment was how focused each member in the group 
								was with their assigned tasks. In addition, each group member was able to provide their information in a timely manner while 
								still holding utmost quality. This allowed the group to be able to manage their time with the assignment effectively, allowing 
								for each task to be completed to the best of one’s ability.  Furthermore, another aspect which went well was each member’s 
								initiative to help out one another with their given tasks when dire assistance was required, this ensured that the assignment 
								was kept on track and we able to complete each task efficiently. The group agrees that aspects which could have been improved 
								would have to be communication between one another while not together during class. Due to personal issues the group could not 
								always collectively meet, which in turn did result in small hiccups which were promptly corrected through communication between 
								one another using social media. One thing that the group found surprising was how well each team member was able to interact with 
								other and get along personally and professionally, despite all only meeting each other for the first time in the course. 
								This ensured that no group members was intimidated to talk or interact with one another, resulting in the successful completion 
								of the assignment. The one thing we have learned about working in a group situation, is just how efficiently assignments such as 
								“IT World” can be completed if everyone in the group is focused and a clear understanding of their task at hand. We have learnt 
								that group assignments can provide a more enjoyable experience when it comes to having to complete assignments due to the support 
								and assistance you can receive from your team members. Overall the Github log which we currently have only somewhat fully reflects 
								how much work the group did to complete the assignment. A majority of the work was completed individually without Github, 
								in addition, at the current point in time not all members had a full understanding on how to use Github, thus it was able to be 
								utilised to its full potential. However, even with our limited knowledge, we were still able to somewhat effectively use the features 
								it provides and successfully complete our assignment.</p>
								
								<h3>Angela Hoang</h3>
								<p>Predominantly, all of the team members of the Wallflower Inc team has done exceptionally well with their divided tasks 
									within this second assignment. The group members were all self-driven to work hard towards completing this assignment, 
									as their input within each section was efficiently done with great detail. Although it was difficult to all meet together 
									at meetings outside of class hours, due to other commitments like work or clashes with class times, it was understandable 
									since the effort and hardworking energy was seen from each member. One thing that could also be improved was the constant 
									communication or just having a few updates from each member, although having other commitments is understandable, it would 
									be more efficient to know where each member was in their current state of divided work during this assignment. 
									One surprising aspect that was encountered when working with this team was how supportive and positive the team was, since 
									this team did not encounter much conflict within the time frame of working on this assignment. 
									The one thing I have learnt about groups is how difficult but efficient it is to share and team up together, as there are 
									many team members that can help me whenever I am having difficulty with a task.</p>

								<h3>Harman Puri</h3>
								<p>Our group was able to work very efficiently on completing this second assignment. Each member of the team was able to complete 
									their responsible part of the assignment in great detail, including from discussing and obtaining honest feedback from 
									other group members. One aspect that could have been better for the next assignment was the extra communication in regards 
									to this assignment, as the sections of the assignment could have been thoroughly completed with greater detail and quality 
									of work with improved time management. One thing that surprised me was the great amount of feedback and support that has 
									been relayed back to me whenever I asked for critique about my part of the assignment. 
									The one thing I learnt about groups is that besides having team members work together well and efficiently, but the friendship 
									between the team is also important to reduce conflicts within the team.</p>

								<h3>James Parsell</h3>
								<p>The group was able to work well together on completing the assignment. 
									The group members were quick to take initiative in completing task that need completing and given tasks were done in a 
									timely matter. The group also helped anyone with a problem that a member might have and worked together to fix any problem 
									that the member might have had. However, communication could have been improved outside of class and organisation of task to 
									be completed could have done better. When the group was communicating face to face, our group could tackle the issues from 
									the assignment efficiently. </p>

								<h3>Joseph Nemhara</h3>
								<p>Overall, the group was very proficient in completing the second assignment. 
									Things that went well were that the group was very diligent in completing the assigned tasks that we were all given. 
									Furthermore, we were all efficient in completing these tasks while being able to handle feedback on aspects of our work 
									that might of needed improving. Group members were also quick and willing to take the initiative in certain aspects of the 
									assignment to get certain tasks completed in time. The only thing that could have been improved would be improved communication 
									between teammates out of class times. The one thing that was surprising was how easily and efficiently the group worked together 
									in completing the assignment. One thing that I have learned about groups is how proficiently assignments can be completed when all 
									group member efficiently contribute to their tasks at hand. This is evident through things such as Github log which indicate that 
									most members effectively contributing to the assignment.</p>

								<h3>Lewis Eldon Reed</h3>
								<p>Our team worked well, particularly in distributing responsibilities early on. We used class time well in that it was used 
									effectively in order to work out how we would complete the project. It was great that each member had a preference immediately 
									for certain types of the project workload, and that these preferences fit harmoniously and without challenges. 
									A problem of attendance did seem to be a recurring issue, however it did not reach a point of becoming a burden on the project 
									at hand. Telephone communication has remained throughout the project time, meaning none of the members of the group were ever 
									confused as to the amount of work still required. When face to face, our group was no problems at beginning start on the work at hand. 
									When github arose, I discovered that my group members had no experience using it yet, so we had to spend a part of the class becoming 
									familiar with it. No one seemed disinterested or unengaged during this session, and they left the class now aware of github's 
									capabilities.</p>

								<h3>Shams Saif</h3>
								<p>The Wallflower Inc team members have worked really well on this assignment, as the project never felt stagnant. Discussions the subjects covered offered very refreshing group interactions. The group did struggle making contact at certain points, but it was quickly bounced back from. The only thing I believe that required improvement was better contact between the group members when we were not able to see each other, despite this, we were still able to work very effectively at completing the assignment. Personally, I was genuinely surprised at how prompt and helpful my team mates were when I required assistance with my given task. This ensured that I did not fall behind our set schedule and was able to complete my duties on time. Through completion of this assignment, I have learnt that groups are probably one of more the more engaging methods of completing an assignment as you are not the only person who carries the burden and can receive assistance even easier.
